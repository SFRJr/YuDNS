YuDNS: Reviving the Legacy of .YU Domains

YuDNS, short for Yugoslav Domain Name Server, is an ambitious project dedicated to restoring the iconic .YU domain. Rooted in the digital heritage of the former Yugoslavia, YuDNS employs a bespoke custom DNS system to provide a platform for preserving cultural, historical, and regional identity in the digital age.

The .YU domain was officially retired in 2010, leaving a gap in the online presence of numerous organisations and individuals connected to the Yugoslav era. By harnessing innovative DNS technologies, YuDNS seeks to create a vibrant ecosystem where users can reclaim and celebrate their association with the .YU identity.

Join us as we connect the past and future of online identity, one domain at a time.
