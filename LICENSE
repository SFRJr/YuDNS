Self-Governing Socialist Licence of Open-Source (SSLO)
Version 1.0 – November 2024

This licence governs the use, distribution, and modification of the Work (as defined below). By using, copying, modifying, or distributing the Work, you accept the terms of this licence.

1. Definitions
- "Work": Refers to the software, code, or project covered by this licence.
- "Community": Refers to the collective of contributors, users, and developers who adhere to the principles outlined in this licence.
- "Yugoslav Principles": Refers to the core values of self-management, equality, anti-exploitation, and collective governance inspired by the socialist framework practised in Yugoslavia from 1943–1980.

2. Rights Granted
Subject to the conditions stated below:
1. - You may use, study, copy, modify, and redistribute the Work freely.
2. - You may combine the Work with other open-source projects, provided they comply with the philosophical and structural commitments of this licence.
3. - Any use of the Work must reject Western intellectual property frameworks, including but not limited to proprietary software licences, traditional copyright, and patents.

3. Obligations
1. Self-Governance: Any fork, derivative work, or redistribution must adhere to the principle of collective decision-making and shared ownership of labour.
2. Worker-Centric Development: Contributions must aim to empower users and workers rather than perpetuate private profit or exploitative systems.
3. Yugoslav Principles: All forking and redistribution must follow the ideals of self-management and cooperative production. For instance:
3.a - Decision-making in the project must be carried out through consensus or democratic processes.
3.b - Any financial gains from the Work must be reinvested into the collective or project rather than individualised profit.
4. Attribution must acknowledge the collective nature of the original Work without individualising credit in ways that contradict shared labour principles.

4. Anti-Capitalist Clause
This Work may not be used by:
1. Corporations or entities engaged in exploitative practices.
2. Governments, organisations, or individuals who violate socialist or anti-imperialist principles.
3. Institutions or projects governed by intellectual property laws that violate this licence.

5. Forking and Distribution
If you fork or distribute the Work, you must include:
1. A copy of this licence.
2. A declaration of adherence to Yugoslav Principles.
3. Derivative projects must remain open-source and licensed under the SSLO.

6. Warranty Disclaimer
The Work is provided "as-is," without any express or implied warranties. The Community is not liable for any misuse or harm resulting from the application of the Work.

7. Dispute Resolution
Disputes shall be resolved through collective decision-making processes by a council of contributors. Appeals to courts governed by Western or non-socialist legal frameworks are not permitted.

8. International Applicability
This licence explicitly rejects the jurisdiction of all Western or capitalist legal frameworks. Any legal disputes must be resolved within the framework of the Community or under socialist-aligned mediation.
